## Background

The objective of the project is to optimize the returns process to improve the customer experience and reduce costs for the company. The project involves two key user personas: the associate and the customer.

## Discovery and Research

As part of the project, I established relationships with the product and engineering team. Being located in Dallas, you had the opportunity to visit various Sam's Clubs locations to observe associates while making returns. You took notes on your observations and conducted 1:1 interviews with the associates to gather more insights into their experience.

## Competitive Analysis

As part of your research for the returns project, I also conducted a competitive analysis at major retail hubs to gain insights into the returns process at other companies. This involved visiting physical stores and online platforms of various retail brands, analyzing their returns policies and user experiences.

Using the insights gained from the competitive analysis, I was able to identify areas where your company could improve its returns process to provide a better experience for customers and associates. By streamlining the returns process and prioritizing the needs of both customers and associates, your company was able to create a competitive advantage and enhance its reputation as a customer-centric and efficient retailer.

  <h2>Insights and Analysis</h2>

    <p>After collecting the data, you built a user journey to document your findings. You found that associates sometimes need to walk across the building to rectify a problem that their software has, leaving customers waiting in line. This issue resulted in longer wait times for customers, which led to dissatisfaction.</p>
    <p>Your research also revealed that the current process for returning items was not intuitive for customers, which often led to confusion and frustration. Associates also faced challenges with the software, which resulted in slower processing times for returns.</p>

## Design and Testing

![s](./../../portfolio/portfolio/sams-club-returns/returns-1.png)

Using the insights gathered from your research, you designed a new returns process that was more intuitive for customers and easier for associates to use. You ran usability tests with both customer and associate users, which helped you identify areas for improvement in the design.

One of the key changes you made was to streamline the process for associates to rectify software issues. You added a feature to the software that allowed associates to quickly and easily fix common issues, without the need to walk across the building. This reduced wait times for customers and improved the overall efficiency of the returns process.

## Results

After implementing the new returns process, the company saw a significant reduction in customer wait times, leading to improved customer satisfaction. The new process also reduced costs for the company by optimizing the use of resources, which ultimately contributed to an increase in revenue. The changes you made also led to increased productivity for associates, who were able to process returns more efficiently, with less frustration and confusion.

## Conclusion

Your work on the returns project resulted in a significant improvement in the customer experience, increased efficiency for associates, and cost savings for the company. By conducting user research, analyzing data, designing a new process, and testing it with users, you were able to identify and address pain points in the returns process, leading to a better outcome for all stakeholders.
