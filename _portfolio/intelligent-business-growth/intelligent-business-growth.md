## Overview

In this UX case study, we will explore the process of designing an application for the finance team that leverages AI and machine learning to assist with creating a new forecast for the business. The goal of this application is to streamline the forecasting process and help the finance team make more accurate predictions about the future of the business. Our main objectives are to improve efficiency, accuracy and user satisfaction.


## Background

The finance team at a large retail company spends a significant amount of time creating forecasts for the business. This process involves analyzing historical data, identifying trends and patterns, and making predictions about the future. The team currently uses Excel spreadsheets and other manual processes to complete this task, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. The company is interested in introducing AI and machine learning to this process to improve efficiency and accuracy.


## Identifying gaps and unknowns
During the early stages of this UX case study, I facilitated a workshop with the stakeholders to determine viable use cases for the application we were developing. The goal of this workshop was to identify the most critical and impactful use cases that we could start tackling in the first phase of the project.

## Vision

As part of my role, I lead the team towards a clear vision for the application we were developing. This was a critical step in ensuring that everyone on the team was aligned and working towards the same goals, especially since we had many stakeholders with different ideas and perspectives.

## Research and strategy

We conducted research to understand the needs and pain points of the finance team. We conducted interviews with finance professionals to understand their workflow, pain points, and goals. We found that the finance team struggles with the time-consuming process of manually creating forecasts. They also expressed frustration with the complexity of the data and the difficulty of identifying relevant trends and patterns. They expressed a desire for an application that would streamline the process and provide more accurate predictions.

## Design

We designed an application that leverages AI and machine learning to assist the finance team in creating forecasts. The system identifies relevant trends and patterns in the data, and provides recommendations for forecasting based on historical data.

The application has a simple and intuitive interface, with features such as data visualization and interactive charts. The user can easily upload historical data into the application and view the predicted future trends based on the data. The application also provides recommendations for adjusting the forecast based on changing market conditions or other factors that may affect the business.



## Testing

We conducted usability testing with the finance team to ensure that the application meets their needs and expectations. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with users reporting that the application streamlined their workflow and saved them significant time in creating forecasts. The team also reported that the application's recommendations were helpful in making more accurate predictions about the future of the business.

## Outcomes and metrics
As part of our effort to tie our outcomes to our user goals, we also led an effort to define trackable metrics that we would use to measure the success of our finance team application. We wanted to ensure that we were not only delivering a tool that met the user's needs and goals but also providing measurable value to the business.

To achieve this, we worked closely with the finance team to define a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that were directly tied to our user goals. These KPIs were focused on metrics such as user engagement, satisfaction, and productivity, which were critical to the success of the finance team application.

## Conclusion

In this UX case study, we designed an application for the finance team that leverages AI and machine learning to assist in creating forecasts for the business. The application streamlined the forecasting process and helped the finance team make more accurate predictions about the future of the business. The application was well-received by the finance team and met their needs and expectations. This project demonstrates the value of UX design in creating applications that meet the needs of users while achieving business goals.
