## Recording Sessions
After the user has completed a workout, they can pull up their recorded session. Replays will be available offering real-time stats and tips. Trend charts will be available after a number of sessions have been recorded. E-Coach will offer tips on how to adjust to prevent against future injuries or general improvements.

## User Goals
Each sport or workout activity comes with it's own set of measurements. For example, goals that are important to a runner may not be preferred by someone trying to improve their golf swing.
