## Perfecting the Pickup

Perfecting the Pickup
In 2012, tapping a button to Uber across the city felt magical. By the start of 2016, this magic receded to a slew of disparate features that made the experience slow and complex to use.

I was part of an ambitious project to redesign the Uber pickup experience for the fastest growing startup in history.

## Design by accretion

In just five years since 2011, Uber transformed from a black car service for 100 friends in San Francisco to a global transportation network. By 2016, Uber delivered over 3 million rides a day in over 400 cities across 70 countries.

The Rider app — designed in 2012, struggled to scale alongside the hyper-growth of the company. Fundamental usability was challenged. Disparate features and experiments competed for focus. App reliability and performance issues increased exponentially.

The Rider app had become the org chart.

Our goal for the project was to recapture the magic of the early days of Uber. The original premise was simple: tap a button, get a ride. However, we weren't trying to revert to a simple past. Our ambitions were to create a strong foundation that embraced a rapidly evolving business and more diverse user base.

Our high level goals were to:

1. Make it fast and easy to use for everyone, everywhere.
1. Give riders more control over their time and money.
1. Create a platform for innovation and deeper engagement.

## Set Design

Initial sketches. Once I had a floor plan, and reviewed it with the team - I went to mock these up in a 3D program. In a past life, I had quite a bit of experience of hacking my way through 3D programs. Sadly most of that has left my brain. I only needed to use the basic of tools to mock this up and get the point across to the vendor that was going to build it.
