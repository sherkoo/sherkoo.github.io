  <h2 class="display">Intro</h2>
  <div class="grid col-8-4">
    <div>
      <p>The company's Rewards program was hosted on a 3rd party server. In order to offer more cohesive, and branded experience to the customer - the business has decided to discontinue serving the rewards portal on a 3rd party service.</p>

  <h2 class="display">Building Empathy</h2>

    <div>
      <p>After understanding the challenges around this task, I looked to for a real life scenario to replicate this scenario. The only problem was I wasn't a rewards member for this particular program, but I was a rewards member for products I used in my consumer life. I got in my car and drove to my nearest pet supply store that I frequently purchased from. I made my purchase, and gave my phone number to build up my rewards. When I got home, I thought "How would I access my reards online?". Google lead me to </p>

  <h2 class="display">Challenges</h2>
  <div class="grid col-8-4">
    <div>
      <p>Since the original Rewards program was served on a 3rd party server written in dated code, it was very difficult to migrate existing users. The database on the company's site could not interact with the database hosted on 3rd party services. This would mean we would need customers to migrate and create a new account. A unfavorable, and unexpected task for any user.</p>

    </div>
    <div>

  <h2 class="display">Who We're Designing For</h2>
  <div class="grid col-8-4">
    <div>
      <p>The Rewards program has been around for over 10 years. A lot of various types of customers have signed up in that time. Some users had an account online, some only had accounts by signing up in the store. Working with the product owner, we narrowed it down to 4 different types.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="display">Research</h2>
  <div class="grid col-8-4">
    <div>
      <p>At this stage, the resarch team and myself performed a heuristic evaluation on the current Rewards experience, as well as our competitors. Fortunately we had access to customer comments online and in-store.</p>

      <p>[INCLUDE FLOWCHARTS] We shaped our solution to work with our customer personas. First through workshoping, and wireframing ideas. We then moved on to low fidelity</p>

  <div class="grid col-8-4">
    <div>
      <p>Working with the team, we built a matrix of all the customer comments. I printed out their quotes, and began looking for patterns. We saw a reoccuring theme around "why are you doing this?". We needed more clarification around the verbiage. We were asking a lot of the customer by merging their account, so being transparent & honest was important.</p>

  <h2 class="display">Results</h2>

    <div>
      <p>During the first 2 weeks of launching the new Rewards platform, 85% of customers migrated their accounts to the new Rewards hub, and spent a total of $2M using their existing rewards.</p>
