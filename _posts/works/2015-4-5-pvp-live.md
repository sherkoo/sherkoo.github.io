## Set Design
The PVP Live set design was designed to showcase competitive gamers while being cast by two hosts. Keeping in line with the PVP Live branding, it was aimed to be clean & professional. Working along side with Diesel Displays, the desk was designed to be the main focus.

## Challenges
Depth is very hard to capture on video. When designing the set, it was key to lighting and textures subdued behind the casters.

## Set Planning
After sketching out various ideas. I moved on to mocking them up in a 3D modeling program SketchUp. This helped the team envision where the stage elements needed to be placed. We tested out various camera angles as well with this method.
