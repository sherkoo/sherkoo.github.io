description: "pvplive.net focuses on supplying stats, analytics, and predictions for major titles in the Esports market. It was designed with HTML5, css3, PHP5 and JQuery. Built with a custom CMS from the ground up, everything was designed from scratch. This project taught the team a lot about scalability within the code and database structure. Tools like gulp.js, git, BEM methodology,  JQuery, and team problem solving became invaluable to building this site. "
