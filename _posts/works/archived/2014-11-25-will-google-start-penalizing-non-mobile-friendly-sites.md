Google [announced](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/11/helping-users-find-mobile-friendly-pages.html?m=1) that they’ll start tagging sites that are mobile friendly. This could affect the SEO rankings in the future.

This change will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks. A page is eligible for the “mobile-friendly” label if it meets the following criteria as detected by Googlebot:

- Avoids software that is not common on mobile devices, like Flash
- Uses text that is readable without zooming
- Sizes content to the screen so users don't have to scroll horizontally or zoom
- Places links far enough apart so that the correct one can be easily tapped

If you want to make sure that your page meets the mobile-friendly criteria: 

- Check your pages with the Mobile-Friendly Test 
- Read our updated documentation on our Webmasters Mobile Guide on how to create and improve your mobile site
- See the Mobile usability report in Google Webmaster Tools, which highlights major mobile usability issues across your entire site, not just one page
- Check our how-to guide for third-party software like WordPress or Joomla, in order to migrate your website hosted on a CMS (Content Management System) to use a mobile-friendly template

I’ve felt for a while that google favored mobile friendly sites, even if they’ve never officially announced it.
