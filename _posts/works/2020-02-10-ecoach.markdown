## Intro

E-Coach bridges the world of athletics, footwear and technology together. Wether you're a solo runner or on a team, the app empowers users by tracking stats based off of their recent workouts/sports activitivies. By allowing users to sync their bluetooth-insoles to their app.

## Service blueprint
A service blueprint helps to visualize all the connecting pieces. I designed the flow based around the connection of the soles. Once the soles are connected, the hard part is over for the user. From here on out, it's all about enjoying the product, and getting value out of it.

## Recording Sessions

After the user has completed a workout, they can pull up their recorded session. Replays will be available offering real-time stats and tips. Trend charts will be available after a number of sessions have been recorded. E-Coach will offer tips on how to adjust to prevent against future injuries or general improvements.

## User Goals

Each sport or workout activity comes with it's own set of measurements. Goals that are important to a runner, may not be preferred by someone trying to improve their golf swing.
