      <h2 class="display">The Approach</h2>
      <p>Before diving into the design for PlayIt, I mapped out a plan to better understand userâ€™s behavior and the competitive landscape. I believe research, planning and testing are essential when designing a new product. User interviews were going to be an important step for this project before jumping into the design.</p>

      <h2 class="display">Initial Research</h2>
        <div>
          <p>I performed a competitive analysis to get a better understanding of how all of the services would work together. What was working well for other competitors, and what wasn't. In doing so, we can start to get a list of some goals the PlayIt app may want to strive for, and where it might stand in the market. During user interviews, we watched users use some other brands software.</p>

Participants are encouraged to throw any idea out there. Even something that seems like a bad idea may spark a good idea in someone else. After we have collected an  list of ideas, I sorted them accordingly.</p>

      <p>PlayIt was designed on an 8px baseline to ensure consistency throughout components. Typography, buttons, images all fall on this baseline. Padding and margins are also designed in multiples of 8. E.g margin-right: 8px, 16px, or 32px. This provides a guideline when new designers or developers pickup the files ensuring consistent results.</p>
