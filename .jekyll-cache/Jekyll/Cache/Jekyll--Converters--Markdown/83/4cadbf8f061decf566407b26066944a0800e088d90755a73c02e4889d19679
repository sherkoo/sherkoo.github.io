I"<<p>I’ve used wordpress a lot for projects. My preferred method is to design and write the theme from scratch. I’ve built a <a href="https://github.com/stephenherko/wordpressblank">blank wordpress shell</a> to automate things a little better. I’ve been intrigued by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for a while now. I’ve built some sites locally but never put anything out in the “real world” with it. I like to build projects from the ground up, as opposed to starting with a bunch of code and hacking my way through until I get something I want.</p>
