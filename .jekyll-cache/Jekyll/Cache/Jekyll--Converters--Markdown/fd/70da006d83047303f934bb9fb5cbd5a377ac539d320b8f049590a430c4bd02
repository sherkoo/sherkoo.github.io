I"≠<p>##Lightweight</p>
<ul>
  <li>Opens and runs very quickly</li>
  <li>(Never) really crashes or freezes</li>
  <li>Even projects with 50-100 files seem to open seamlessly</li>
</ul>

<p>Speed is very important to my workflow. I can‚Äôt stand that feeling of waiting for my editor when my brain is already on to the next step.</p>

<p>##Easy To Customize</p>
<ul>
  <li>Package manager - allows you to install extensions to help you develop more efficiently</li>
  <li>Fetch - Great for fetching things from github</li>
  <li>Emmet - Amazing for fast front end development</li>
  <li>Themes - Never locked into how your editor looks</li>
  <li>Feels like an editor you can program to fit your needs</li>
</ul>

<p>##Quick Open</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses fuzzy search which allows you to search for files without typing the exact file name</li>
  <li>Saves time</li>
  <li>‚Äú:‚Äù allows you to quickly go to a line</li>
</ul>

<p>##Overall UI</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tabs at top - easy to see what‚Äôs open</li>
  <li>Files/sidebar on left</li>
  <li>Clean, simple and effective</li>
  <li>Again, very easy to change the overall colors, UI, and theme based on your preference</li>
</ul>

<p>##Snippets
I‚Äôve been using snippets less these days, but they still have their place in my workflow. The emmet package comes with a lot preloaded I use on a day to day. Sublime is probably the best I‚Äôve seen at making your own snippets, customizing and organizing them.</p>
