<p>I’m a product designer working in the tech field. I approach all projects with the scientific method searching for objectivity and truth. I believe developing a deep understanding of social behavior, and prototyping (a lot) is the key to good product design.</p>

<p>I speak for the customer or user. I love building empathy and stepping into the user’s shoes to understand frustrations. I also dive into the analytical side of UX combing through data, locating patterns and looking for opportunities to improve products.</p>
