<p>With a passion for creating intuitive and user-centered designs. I have 15+ years of experience in the industry, and have worked on a wide range of projects for clients in industries like esports, ecommerce, and service design.</p>

<p>I believe that good UX design is about more than just making something look pretty - it’s about understanding the needs and goals of the user and creating an experience that is both functional and enjoyable. My goal as a designer is to create products and experiences that are intuitive, easy to use, and add value to people’s lives.</p>

<p>I have a strong foundation in UX principles, including user research, prototyping, usability testing, and design thinking. I am skilled in a variety of design tools.</p>

<p>As a lead UX designer at my company, I have the opportunity to work with a diverse team of designers, including both mid-level and junior designers. I enjoy mentoring and guiding my team members as they develop their skills and grow in their careers. I am always looking for ways to foster a collaborative and inclusive work environment, and I believe that the best design solutions are often the result of teamwork and open communication.</p>

<p>I am responsible for leading the design process for our projects, from initial research and ideation to prototyping and user testing. I work closely with our project managers and development team to ensure that our designs are feasible and aligned with our clients’ goals. I also play a key role in defining our team’s design processes and best practices, and I am always looking for ways to improve our efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Overall, my role as a lead UX designer allows me to use my experience and expertise to guide and support the development of our team, while also challenging myself to constantly learn and grow in my own career.</p>

<p>I am always looking for new opportunities to challenge myself and grow as a designer. If you have a project that you think I would be a good fit for, I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>I like to explore the intersection between philosophy and design <a href="/articles">“found here”</a>. I am fascinated by the idea that the principles of design can be applied not only to objects but also to our lives and how we think about the world around us. Through my writing, I aim to blend philosophical concepts with design principles to create thought-provoking pieces that challenge readers to think differently about the world. I believe that by examining the design of our lives, we can create more meaningful and fulfilling experiences.</p>
