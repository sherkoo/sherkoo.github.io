    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>When myself and 4 others founded PVPLive, the competitive video gaming scene was still in its early stages. The industry was mostly operated by fans with unprofessional graphics, and everything was DIY. As the designer for the startup, I wanted to provide creative direction that would push esports into what it could be, and completely redesign esports graphics so that people would take the industry more seriously.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <!-- objectives -->
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Redesign esports graphics to improve the overall user experience for viewers and players</li>
      <li>Create a consistent and professional brand image for PVP Live in the esports industry</li>
      <li>Enhance the visual appeal of the esports matches and tournaments to attract a wider audience</li>
      <li>Increase the engagement and retention of viewers and players by providing an immersive and exciting experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning About Our Users</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gamers are extremely passioniate individuals, who take their love for competition very seriously. It defines who they are, and establishes the identity for many.</li>
      <li>By nature, most of them are introverts that yearn for a community.</li>
      <li>Platforms like Twitch really empowered gamers by creating a community and a hub to find other like-minded individuals.</li>
      <li>Gamers can spot inauthenticity very easily, and will shy away from organizations trying to take advantage of them.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- approach -->

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<ol class="grid-6 grid-1-mobile">
  <li>Research: Before starting the design process, we conducted extensive research on the esports industry and its audience. We also analyzed the graphics and visuals used in other esports tournaments and matches. This helped us understand the user a bit more, what was the level of expectations for esports productions, and provided insights into the visual language of the industry.</li>
  <li>Conceptualization: Based on the research, we developed a few initial concepts for the new esports graphics. These concepts were presented to the stakeholders, and after discussion and feedback, we finalized the direction we wanted to go in.</li>
  <li>Design: The design process involved creating a new visual identity for PVP Live, which included a new logo, color palette, and typography. We also developed a consistent set of visual elements that could be used across all esports matches and tournaments. These elements included overlays, scoreboards, player and team graphics, and motion graphics.</li>
  <li>Testing: Once the designs were ready, we conducted user testing to validate the effectiveness of the new graphics. We tested with both players and viewers to understand the usability, engagement, and overall experience of the new graphics.</li>

    <h2>Partnerships</h2>
    <p>In order to promote our competitive gaming tournaments and establish ourselves as a serious player in the esports industry, we partnered with two gaming icons: Blizzard and Twitch. Together, we organized and promoted competitive Hearthstone gaming tournaments on the Twitch platform. The tournaments were designed to be accessible for players from all over the world, allowing them to stream from their location and participate in the tournament. The partnership allowed us to leverage the reach and credibility of Blizzard and Twitch to attract a larger audience, as well as establish our brand as a reputable and professional organizer of esports tournaments.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The tournaments were broadcasted live on the Twitch platform, with expert commentators providing play-by-play coverage and analysis. The partnership also allowed us to offer exciting prizes and incentives to the winners, including cash prizes and exclusive in-game rewards.</p>

<div class="grid-6 grid-1-mobile">
  <h2>Stage Design</h2>
  <p>Designing a production set completely from the ground up was an exciting task. In hte past, we've created first iteration for our stage. Our team was determined to create a second iteration of a stage that would elevate our productions to the next level. Throughout the process, we learned a great deal about lighting and how certain colors would show up on the screen, allowing us to fine-tune our approach to ensure the best possible results. We also made the decision to bring in a crane to put our cameras on, which allowed us to capture shots from unique angles and perspectives. Working closely with our production team, we were able to create a set that met our needs and exceeded our expectations, giving us the tools we needed to take our productions to new heights and fit into the visual language.</p>
