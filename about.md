# Welcome,

I'm a product designer working in the tech field because I have an unending interest in human behavior. I've always been the "observing" type throughout my life, absorbing information and seeing how other people interact with each other. I approach all projects with the scientific method searching for objectivity and truth. My interest for user experience and psychology continues to grow and develop. I believe developing a deep understanding of human and social behavior, and prototyping (a lot) is the key to good product design.

## Solving Problems Through Empathy & Research

I speak for the customer or user. I love building empathy and stepping into the user's shoes to understand frustrations. I also dive into the analytical side of UX combing through data, locating patterns and looking for opportunities to improve products.

## When I'm Not Working

I enjoy reading old books about philosophy, & cooking pasta dishes.
