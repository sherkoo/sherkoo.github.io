      <h1 class="display">Hello, My Name is Stephen</h1>
      <p>I'm a UX designer working in the tech field because I have an unending interest in human behavior. I've always been the "observering" type throughout my life, absorbing information and seeing how other people interact with each other. I
        approach all projects with the scientific method searching for objectivity and truth. My interest for user experience and psychology continues to grow and develop. I believe developing a deep understanding of human and social behavior, and prototyping (a lot) is the key to good product design.</p>

      <h2 class="display">Solving Problems Through Empathy &amp; Research</h2>

      <p>As a UX designer, I speak for the customer. I love building empathy and stepping into the customer's shoes to understand frustrations. I also dive into the analytical side of UX combing through data, locating patterns and looking for
        opportunites to improve products.</p>

      <h2 class="display">When I'm Not Working</h2>
      <p>I enjoy reading old books about philosphy, &amp; cooking pasta dishes.</p>
