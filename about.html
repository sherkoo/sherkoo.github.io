    <h1 class="display">Hello, My Name is Stephen</h1>
    <p>I'm a UX designer working in the tech field because I have an unending interest in human behavior. I've always been the "observering" type throughout my life, absorbing information and seeing how other people interact with each other. I approach all projects with the scientific method obtaining objectivity and truth. My interest for user experience and psychology continues to grow and develop. I believe developing a deep understanding of human and social behavior is the key to good product design.</p>

    <h2 class="display">Solving Problems Through Empathy &amp; Research</h2>

    <p>As a UX designer, I speak for the customer. I love building empathy and stepping into the customer's shoes to understand frustrations. I also dive into the analytical side of UX combing through data, locating patterns and looking for opportunites to improve products.</p>


    <!-- <p>I started my career in visual design, branding and marketing. I learned how to work with clients delivering completed projects. After some time, I found myself frustrated with the subjectivity that comes with that line of work. I realized this was not enough for me, and I sought a career change.</p> -->

    <!-- <h3>Something New</h3>
    <p>In 2012, myself and a group of individuals formed a start up. This was my first introduction to user experience and product design. From here I learned how valuable it is to put the user first when designing a product. I was moving away from visual design, and into something that made so much more sense to me. Using analytics, mapping out journies, solving problems with data and strategy really spoke to me.</p> -->

    <h2 class="display">When I'm Not Working</h2>
    <p>I enjoy reading old books about philosphy, &amp; cooking pasta dishes</p>
