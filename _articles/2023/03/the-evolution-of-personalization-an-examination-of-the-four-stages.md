The advent of the internet and the rise of web-based technologies have transformed the way people interact with information, entertainment, and each other. One of the most significant changes brought about by the internet is the evolution of personalization in the web space. Personalization has become a pervasive feature of online experiences, and it has evolved over the years. In this essay, we will discuss the four stages of personalization in the web space over the last 20 years, using book recommendations as an example.

## The first stage

of personalization in the web space was person-to-person recommending books. This was the early days of the internet when websites were simple and user-generated content was limited. At this stage, personalization was relatively basic and mostly dependent on human interactions. The recommendation process was largely a person-to-person affair, where individuals would share book recommendations with each other via email or chat. There were no sophisticated algorithms or machine learning technologies in place to facilitate the process. Instead, it was a simple matter of one person telling another person what books they should read.

## The second stage

of personalization in the web space was when sites started to suggest books based on user preferences. As the web became more popular, websites started to incorporate algorithms to suggest books to users based on their preferences. For example, if a user liked philosophy, the site would suggest books in that genre. This stage of personalization was a significant improvement over the previous one because it relied on data and technology rather than just human recommendations.

## The third stage

of personalization in the web space is more in line with the current day. In this stage, users are logged into their book app, and the app knows what they have been reading. Based on this data, the app can make recommendations tailored to the user's interests. For example, if a user has been reading a lot of non-fiction books on history, the app may suggest other books in that genre. This stage of personalization is more advanced than the previous two because it is personalized based on the user's behavior and preferences.

## The fourth and stage of the future

of personalization in the web space is where AI comes into play. In this stage, users can communicate with AI and manipulate the algorithm until they get a result they are happy with. Once they get their results, they can further tweak their recommendations by saying something like "show me more up-to-date options." This stage of personalization is the most sophisticated yet, and it is constantly evolving.

In conclusion, personalization has come a long way in the web space over the last 20 years. From person-to-person recommendations to AI-powered algorithms, personalization has become an integral part of our online experiences. Book recommendations are just one example of how personalization has evolved in the web space. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more sophisticated forms of personalization emerge, and the possibilities are endless. However, as personalization continues to become more advanced, we must also be mindful of its potential downsides, such as algorithmic bias and the loss of serendipity in our online experiences.
